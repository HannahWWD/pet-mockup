# Fluffy - Pet Adoption Website

## Introduction

This is the pet matching path mockup for my UX design project - Fluffy. For more information, please visit https://www.hannahwu.design/Pet .

## Live Demo

:sparkles:  https://fluffy-pet-adoption.netlify.app/

## Getting Started
In the root folder, run

```
npm install
npm start
```
The app should not work properly at **PORT 3000**.

## Build App
```
npm run build
```

## Future work
There is a sliding motion when switching the cards in the original design. I am still trying to figure out how to integrate this feature into the app efficiently.
